<h1>The Beers</h1>
<p>The Brew Moon Brewing Co is a completely independent craft brewery. We produce a small range of microbrews in 600L batches at our brewery near Amberley. Our beers are made from the best malted grains, hops, yeast and pure Amberley well water. They take longer to produce than most commercial brews because we do not pasteurise or filter as we believe that these practices remove flavour  and reduce the natural health-giving qualities of our beer.</p>
